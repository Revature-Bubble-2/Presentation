- *DO NOT* keep saying "now I'll pass it off to ______"
- Weave tech used into the demo, include logo slide? looks clean
- *Don't let the front end be an afterthought*
- Presentation should be interesting enough that the people presenting it don't look glazed over in boredom
- Have nice diagrams
- Have team read article if they can
- Add security improvement as stretch (figure out how it all actually works too i guess)
