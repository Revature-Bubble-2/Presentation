### DO NOT SAY:
    - "Today I'm going to talk about..."
    - "I'm a full stack java developer here at Revature."
    - "I mentioned that before" (during q&a, treat it like its brand new and elaborate on the concept)
- Do not talk off a script while speaking, look at camera and attempt to connect with audience (try and watch other team members)
- Do not thank people for listening after you are done talking

# Definitely
- Begin with introductions
- Architecture Diagram
- INFLECTION: We want this to be a discussion
- --> Lets make it for each other, make the ocasional joke or reference talk to each other not at each other
- Have teams coordinate outfits
- Standardize Zoom names
- FRONT END TOUCH UP
- If we are bored, the audience is bored. Lets not be boring.
- Politely pass back to Carolyn
- Outline Q&A Guidelines aka raise hand
- Be confident when answering!! Stand by your choices!!

# Maybe
- Suggested Questions (Is that too cheeky?)
- --> Can allow people to prep and show off
